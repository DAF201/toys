required package: RimoChan/kill3d

     pip install git+https://github.com/RimoChan/kill3d.git
  go to the folder, enter "python main.py" or "python test.py" <-- I prefer this one
  
  Ctrl + z : camera screenshot
  
  Ctrl + x : full screen screenshot
  
  Esc : escape from cameramode
  
  Ctrl + C : stop

(main is multi-threading,test is multi-processing, I feel like multiprocessing is just overall better)

<h>Will look like this</n>
