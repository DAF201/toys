    Before I end this, I really have a lot to say about the home assistant... How can something possibly have such shitty docs? Official docs are just like corpse chunks being chopped, randomly thrown on the floor, partially missing and some of them even started to rot. Bugs, explanation missing, structure confusing and out of date information are literally everywhere in the official doc.
